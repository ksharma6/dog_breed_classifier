### About Dataset
**Context**
The Stanford Dogs dataset contains images of 120 breeds of dogs from around the world. This dataset has been built using images and annotation from ImageNet for the task of fine-grained image categorization. It was originally collected for fine-grain image categorization, a challenging problem as certain dog breeds have near identical features or differ in colour and age.

**Content**
- Number of categories: 120
- Number of images: 20,580
- Annotations: Class labels, Bounding boxes
